Mobility impaired users experience physical and cognitive barriers in public transport use (e.g., fixed-route transportation services), which limits their independency, access to employment, social and recreational involvement. This research aimed to identify objective measures of user performance that can be used to operationalize accessibility and usability of mobility impaired users while riding public transit buses. Participants with varying level of mobility impairments were studied (n=96 including manual wheelchair, powered wheelchair, scooter, visually impaired, and cane users). We collected usersâ€™ kinematic movement and physiological responses using different type of wearable sensors while they are riding public buses. We collaborated with the Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Center at the University of Michigan for recruiting participant and conducting our study. 

This project was sponsored by the National Institute for Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research on accessible, inclusive public transportation ([NIDILRR](https://www.acl.gov/about-acl/about-national-institute-disability-independent-living-and-rehabilitation-research)).
