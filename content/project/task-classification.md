Miniaturization and cost reduction of wearable sensors over the past decades allow researchers to obtain human movement and physiological data in less obtrusive and inexpensive ways. Wearable sensors have been considered as an alternative way for direct measurement in human factors area. However, the software application to obtain, process, and analyze the sensor data for the purpose of human factors application is still lagging. 

Poor work conditions in terms of the duration, frequency and intensity of physical work such as in manual manufacturing and material handling cause about one-third of work-related disabilities and costs the US economy $13.8 billion in workers’ compensation. Research in occupational ergonomics has traditionally focused on repetitive work such as in automobile assembly which is consistent and straightforward to model mathematically. In contrast, my research focuses on models to estimate workload and injury risk from workers’ exposures to risk factors of high force exertions and awkward postures in non-routinized work such as in patient-care (ex. nurses, patient transporters) and construction work. This type of work is very variable work conditions, decentralized, and will continue to be a large part of the US economy going forwards. I developed a novel approach by leveraging machine learning techniques with fundamental knowledge in human biomechanics for estimating workload and injury risk in workers from sparse, incomplete measurements taken using low-cost wearable inertial sensing devices in empirical laboratory experiments and field studies.
