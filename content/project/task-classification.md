Work conditions that require prolonged awkward postures and high force exertions repetitively such as in manual manufacturing and material handling cause about one-third of work-related injuries and costs the US economy $13.8 billion in worker’s compensation. Accurate and comprehensive assessment on physical exposure can aid developing appropriate intervention strategies that can reduce the risk of work-related injuries. As a research trainee on a pilot project from the Center for Occupational Health and Safety Engineering (funded through the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health) and for my dissertation, I developed an assessment tool that estimate the physical workload of workers exposed to different work conditions using wearable inertial sensors. This tool can classify work tasks and its intensities from the sensor-derived postural data by leveraging machine learning techniques built with knowledge in human biomechanics. Traditionally, work task and intensity information was obtained by using additional methods such as direct observation and force measurement system which are costly, cumbersome, and may not be adequate for field use. My work allows obtaining contextual work-related exposure information without additional measurement system, which can minimize the cost associated with exposure assessment.
