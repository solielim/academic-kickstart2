The prevalence of obesity (BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2) is increasing worldwide. Individuals with higher BMI experience greater risk of mobility impairment and falls, activity limitations compared with individuals with lower BMI. Maintaining balance is more challenging when standing on one leg, which can be easily found on many daily activities (e.g., walking, staircase climbing, stepping in and out of a bathtub). My research has focused on investigating quantitative metrics to assess dynamic balance of individuals with high BMI during one leg standing. Further research can extend the findings from this research to develop a real-time automatic detection algorithm identifying poor or loss of balance in individuals with high BMI. 

This project was internally funded through [MCubed2 project](https://mcubed.umich.edu/) from the University of Michigan.
