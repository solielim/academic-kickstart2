The prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) is increasing worldwide. Individuals with higher BMI experience greater risk of mobility impairments and falls, and activity limitations compared with individuals with lower BMI. Maintaining balance is more challenging when standing on one leg, which can be easily found on many daily activities (e.g., walking, staircase climbing, stepping in and out of a bathtub). My research has focused on investigating quantitative metrics to assess dynamic balance of individuals with high BMI during one leg standing with the use of wearable inertial sensors. Data analysis is still in progress and the result of this research will be used to develop a real-time automatic detection algorithm identifying poor or loss of balance in individuals with high BMI.  

This project was internally funded through [MCubed2 project](https://mcubed.umich.edu/) from the University of Michigan.
