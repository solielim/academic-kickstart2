abstract = "To determine the effects of mode of load carriage and load magnitude on gait parameters using body-worn inertial sensors, nine participants performed walk trials at self-selected speeds while carrying hand loads in two modes (two-handed side vs. anterior) at four load levels (empty-handed, 4.5 kg, 9.1 kg, and 13.6 kg). Six temporal gait parameters, six postural sway parameters, and three measures of thoracic-pelvic coordination were calculated from data recorded by six body-worn inertial sensors for 540 gait cycles. Results demonstrated that gait patterns characterized by inertial sensors-derived temporal and kinematic gait parameters changed systematically by the mode of load carriage and load magnitude, after adjusting for gait cycle duration and stride length. Measures of thoracic-pelvic coordination and sway in the coronal and transverse planes showed trends of significant practical relevance and may provide sufficient information to typify alterations in gait across two-handed side vs. anterior load carriage of different magnitudes."
